## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

**This is not a typical terminal emulator.**

Haunted-OS is an immersive psychological horror experience that uses your real system information, tracks your behavior, and progressively descends into digital nightmare. It is designed to be uncomfortable, unsettling, and deeply personal.

**Before you run this:**
- ‚úÖ You understand this is a horror simulation
- ‚úÖ You consent to having your username, hostname, and system info displayed
- ‚úÖ You're in a mentally stable place to experience psychological horror
- ‚úÖ You can close the window at any time (that's the real escape)

**This program does NOT:**
- ‚ùå Access your actual webcam (the indicator is fake)
- ‚ùå Upload any data to external servers
- ‚ùå Modify your actual system files
- ‚ùå Persist after closing (no startup items, no hidden processes)
- ‚ùå Access your browser history, contacts, or personal files

## üé≠ What is Haunted-OS?

Haunted-OS begins as a minimalist terminal interface. Type commands like `ls`, `whoami`, `date`. Everything seems normal.

Then the anomalies begin.

Phantom files appear bearing **your real name**. The autocomplete suggestions twist from helpful to disturbing: *"list_all_dead_bodies?"* flickers where `ls` should be. A red webcam indicator pulses to life. The system learns your typing patterns and uses them against you.

Commands corrupt. History shows entries you never typed. The prompt itself decays. At **command 30**, the "fifth wall" shatters: you realize someone *designed* this horror specifically to manipulate you.

Time dilates. `exit` fails. `sudo` grants false power that backfires. The boundary between user and program dissolves.

But at **command 50**, something changes. Cryptic hints flicker through the chaos:
fr33d0m
...eedom
freedom?
...type it...

An escape protocol emerges. Real liberation awaits‚Äîif you can find it.

All the commands used are very well-known ones. If you are new to these commands kindly refer the instructions given below:

1. ls - List all files in directory
2.cat - Show the contents of files
3.exit

üéÆ How to Play

Run the program: python3 haunted_os.py

üß† Psychology Behind the Horror
Haunted-OS doesn't rely on jump scares or gore. Instead, it employs:
Personalization
Uses your real system information to break the barrier between fiction and reality.
Progressive Escalation
Starts normal to establish trust, then slowly introduces anomalies.
Loss of Control
Commands fail, system ignores input, exit doesn't work.
Meta-Awareness
Acknowledges someone programmed your discomfort intentionally.
Complicity
You chose to run this. You stay by choice. That's the real horror.
